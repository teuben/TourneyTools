Some notes on Using BTP with PTT  (Peter's Tourney Tools)
=========================================================

The TourneyTools are able to take a players registration list (the
emails that contains "keyword=value" pairs) into the various text files
for preparing registration and import into TP. We've used a variety
of formats  for a number of years now (dcopen, njopen, mida and also
Koshy's format from the PA website).

For each event, which we normally call something like "ms-A", it will
produce a ms-A.list file as well as a ms-A.csv (comma separated value)
file. Sadly, TP does not like the latter one, so they need to be
transformed into excel (.xls) files to automate the import into TP.

Luckily there is a tool to do this automatically in OpenOffice, see
the csv2xls shell script.

It's quite possible you can also do this on a windows box, or mac, 
but my current experience is solely with linux.

The XLS files can be imported into TP once you have established a
tournament, and you have created events and told it the size (16 or 32
or even 64teams). There is somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd pulldown at the
top an IMPORT action   <<gotta get better description of this>>

One comment on singles vs. doubles: for doubles a pair is defined by
two consquetive lines, e.g. line 1 and 2 are the first pair, line 3
and 4 are the 2nd pair etc.  When you import this XLS file it is thus
very important to click on that button in the lower left to "link up
pairs" (or whatever it's called), otherwise you'll have a big mess.
Also, PTT puts the male first in mixed doubles, these are IBF
requirements.


CURRENT FLAWS:
=============

TourneyTools doesn't use USAB numbers, but defines a uniq player ID which we
use during the tournament. They are 1 .. number_of_players in the tournament,
and for other reasons are defined by when they registered (1 being the first,
N being the last). Sometimes comes in handy if you have to give preference
based on this rank.
