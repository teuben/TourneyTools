Some notes on Using BTP with PTT  (Peter's Tourney Tools)
=========================================================


PREPARATION
===========

The TourneyTools are able to take a players registration list
(those emails that contains "keyword=value" pairs) into the various text
files for preparing registration and import into TP. We've used a
variety of formats for a number of years now (dcopen, njopen, mida and
also Koshy's format from the PA website).

For each event, which we normally call something like "ms-A", it will
produce a ms-A.list file as well as a ms-A.csv (comma separated value)
file. Sadly, TP does not like the latter one, so they need to be
transformed into excel (.xls) files to automate the import into TP.

Luckily there is also a tool to do this automatically in OpenOffice, see
the csv2xls shell script, although it is not too much labor to convert a
"csv" file into an "xls" file.

It's quite possible you can also do this on a windows box, or mac, 
but my current experience is solely with linux.

The XLS files can be imported into TP once you have established a
tournament, and you have created events and told it the size (16 or 32
or even 64 teams). There is somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd pulldown at the
top an IMPORT action   <<gotta get better description of this>>

One comment on singles vs. doubles: for doubles a pair is defined by
two consquetive lines, e.g. line 1 and 2 are the first pair, line 3
and 4 are the 2nd pair etc.  When you import this XLS file it is thus
very important to click on that button in the lower left to "link up
pairs" (or whatever it's called), otherwise you'll have a big mess.
Also, PTT puts the male first in mixed doubles, these are IBF
requirements.

INSTALLATION
============
Make sure you have the correct licence for BTP. The two files,
TP.DAT and TP.PD need to be in "Program Files/Visual Reality/BTP/"


WORKFLOW
========

1) create a new tournament
   Tournament ->New

   ? it is adviced to use a folder in the default location BTP suggest, and 
   maybe make a shortcut to this folder from the desktop, otherwise BTP
   keeps forcing you to navigate too much through the filesystem)
   It likes "My Documents/Tournaments"

   ->template1

2) Add properties
   Under 'Events', add (or pick) events. No size of the draw is needed
   yet, and the events can also be imported from another tournament.

   -> template2

3) Now for each event in the [Roster] do the following:
   (it helps to click on [Roster] on the left side, and select each event)

   Draw->Add Draw
   	     select Elimination, ->Next
	     Select size (2,4,8,16,32,...), confirm name, no Playoff 3/4, -> Next
	     Select 'First Match' (3rd bullet, need this each time) -> Next  
	     Select columns 'MemberID' and 'State' for the layout -> Next
	     Finish

	     at this stage these events still have 0 entries of course

   Once this is done, it's perhaps best to save this file in a template.
   Be sure when you do this, you CLOSE the database (the tournament),
   then go into explorer,and copy/paste to make that backup. This is
   very important, otherwise the copy is probably not sane.

   -> template3

4) Now foreach event you the enter the players:

   Player->Import Entries
          ->Browse ; to your XLS file
	  ->next
	  (the default fields should be correct, but check on your first import)
	  <HIT ->NEXT a few time until you have to select the Event

	  select the event you want to have this imported to.
	  IF THIS IS A DOUBLES EVENT, MAKE SURE YOU ALSO CHECK OFF THE 
	  'Link partners in odd and even rows'
	  on the lower left of the entry form.

	  ->Finish

	  if you now click on the Entries tab of this draw, you should see the newly
	  imported players

	  Now proceed and double click on the players/teams that are to be seeded
	  There is a "Seed:" entry for this once the 'Entry properties' are open.
	  -> OK
	  repeat this for 1, 2, 3/4 and 5/8.  since there are no Shadow-Seed options
	  for this program, the next level of 3/4, 5/8, 9/16 .... will have to be used

	  I don't see an option to rank by state.
     
    Draw->Make Draws

    	  select 'Separation' by 'State' in one of the selections that will come up
	  
	  look at the draw, if not happy, try 'Re-make Draw' or go ->Back and try
	  something else....
	  most likely manually swap players. See below, since that's a bit tricky.



5) It is also possible to manually modify a draw, as follows:

   From the left 'Draws' click on a draw and on the right you'll see the draw 
   Suppose A and B need to be swapped, do this:

   	   highlight A, right click, Delete Entry  (entry is actually put aside for later re-entry)
	   highlight B, right click, Delete Entry
	   highlight the spot where A was, right click, Select Entry
	   	     now select B, and OK this
	   highlight the spot where B was, right click, Select Entry
	   	     now select A, and OK this
   



Reminder of color codes the draws will have:

	 grey - nothing done, event just exists, nothing else
	        next step would be "Draw->Add Draw"
	 orange - after draw was added (size and elimination type given)
	 	next step would be "Player->Import entries"
		then "Draw->Make Draw"
	 yellow - after entries added and draws made

	 red - something bad, e.g. players important but no
	 green - all done?



6) Now that your have all entries in the draws, you can setup the times to play, 
   the courts, the gyms, order or play etc.etc.   Outside the current scope.
	  


CURRENT FLAWS:
=============

TourneyTools doesn't use USAB numbers, but defines a uniq player ID which we
use during the tournament. They are 1 .. number_of_players in the tournament,
and for other reasons are defined by when they registered (1 being the first,
N being the last). Sometimes comes in handy if you have to give preference
based on this rank.

FILES:
======

template1	only named the tournament "dcopen", added the logo
template2	added the usual dcopen {ms,ws,md,wd,xd}-{A,C,S} events
template3	added the sizes (32,16,32,16,32) A,C and (16,4,16,4,16) S
template4	added courts and timeslots (12,

- random notes:

on times: use 1-day, and start and step and number of steps
   16:30 - 23:30 is 13 steps of 30
   08.15 - 22:50 is 26 steps of 35
   08:30 - 15:30 is 13 steps of 35
