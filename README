Information on the older V1 of PTT (Peter's TourneyTools) is on:  
	http://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/badminton/tourney/

The old version is a mix of shell, awk, grep etc.

Requirement for the new one are:

	python
	ipython (strongly suggested)

In the examples below, i will assume you have ipython, since this
makes sessions managment, history recall, reloading code and data
a lOT easier.




% ipython                               <-- type on command line
> import ptt                            <-- the tourney code
s=ptt.Registration('seniors2002',2)     <-- read in the 2002 seniors
s.reload()                              <-- reload data, imagine you've edited players
reload(ptt)                             <-- reload code, imagine you've edited code
s.list('ms-1')
 1: Alan Mills (CO)
 2: Armando Del Carpio (FL)
 3: Kirill Boyarin (MA)
...

 s.list('md-1')
 1: Alan Mills (CO) Simon Thermadam
  : Alan Mills      Simon Thermadam (NY)		<-- check partner name
 2: Armando Del Carpio (FL) Andy Chong
  : Armando Del Carpio      Andy Chong (MA)
 3: Kirill Boyarin (MA) Ravi Raveendran
  : Kirill Boyarin      Ravi Raveendran (MA)
 4: Zhiping You (MA) Robert Lee
  : Zhiping You      Robert Lee (MA)
  : Simon Thermadam (NY) Alan Mills                     <-- double check partner's partner
  : Simon Thermadam      Alan Mills (CO)




Of course this is no way to get the output in a file for further processing. So, here's
the magic of shell scripts. Create a file like this:

#! /bin/env python
#

import ptt

r = ptt.Registration('seniors2006',2)
r.sort1()
r.list1()
r.states()
r.listall(True)
r.need()
r.map()
r.match_count()


and call it "seniors.py". This file can be created with any ordinary editor, e.g. emacs, vi or even notepad.
To make this file executable, so you can run it from the command line, do this is unix:

% chmod +x seniors.py

after which you can run it as follows:

% seniors.py > log1

the output from the script has been redirected to a file called 'log1'
