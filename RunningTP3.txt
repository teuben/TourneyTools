Some notes on Using BTP for triple elimination
===============================================

BTP now supports our triple elimination format through
the Triple Slate format, though they give them plate based names:

    A = Main draw (N players -> N-1 matches)
    B = Special Plate (N/4 players -> (N/4)-1 matches)  - but they make an N/2 draws
    C = Plate (N/2 players -> (N/2)-1 matches)
    D = Consolation Plate (N/4 players -> (N/4)-1 matches)


You make an Elimination round, and then select Triple Slate.
