Some notes on Using BTP 
========================

In another document I had explained how to use BTP with my own unix
tools (PTT), but alas, this is not for the big masses, despite that
it's more powerful and cheaper (as in free) to use. So, now we're
paying an annual fee for BTP (though the USAB should be paying for
this), plus an event fee if you want to put BTP integrated with an
online registration form. Plus the 3-4% paypal transactions fees.

Sorry for the rant, now to the real meat of this story.


The big advantage of using BTP with the online (tournamentsoftware.com) 
system is that everybody has an account with personal info (USAB# etc.)
Plus you can live publish your tournament.

OUTLINE
=======

For the newcomers, here's the outline what you have to do (I will use BTP
when referring to the program, and TS when referring to the online web
stuff)

- download the BTP program (in the right language, or you will get it in Dutch :-)
  from http://www.tournamentsoftware.com 

  If you already have one, there might be a problem if it's too old. If it offers
  you to upgrade, might not want to do that, because it will cripple your
  version as you don't have the correct license key.

- get a license key from USAB or your friendly BTP helper. You can load in this
  key form the program  <details.....>
  Note: licenses are typically only valid for a year.

- start a new tournament. (Open->New).  Either do it the hard way, or after this
  first step import information from another TP file and edit that one. That is 
  usually easier to do , as you wind up clicking yourself to death in BTP.

- get a paypal account, and you'll need to set this up as a Premier account,
  as BTP needs that to talk to TS.

- get the paypal Certified ID set up. You do this by taking the public certificate
  (a PED (?) file) that you can download from TS, and uploading that once you are
  inside of your paypal account. Find the
  profile -> ... -> sellers -> encrypted blabla
  and "Add" your bla bla. It will return some 16 letter "Cert ID", which BTP wants you
  to fill out before you can publish (push info from BTP into TS) your tournament.

  (the good thing here was that the last year's info still worked, you only need the
  paypal gmail account you used, and the 16 letter "Cert ID" you used last year
  in the "Payments" tab of the publish portion in BTP.

- before you publish, review some options. There are places to enter the URL of the
  tournament, the Publish->Regulations doesn't allow html links, but the Properties
  does have a slot for it.
  

FAQ

A Few Pitfalls
==============

- I downloaded the 2013 version into BTP2013, but despite that, it wiped
  an existing older  version (with proper license key) in BTP out. I 
  find this rather intrusive, and I didn't give permission to the program
  to wipe software I had a reason to save. In my case, I had to wait 
  several hours to my license key to arrive, and was in limbo and could
  not play with the new version until I got the license key.


another wonderful BTP error.

- error 4009 cannot overwrite existing finished tournament
  this is so cryptic. i had to google, and understand dutch
  to figure out i can't copy an old TP file, i have to
  create a new from scratch, and important the old one.
  even then , some fields (despite i did click All everywhere)
  were not filled in.
  I'd suggest you can blank this setting in the tournament
  properties. It makes no sense to have it this way, smells 
  like a design flaw.

- if we switch laptops, and have the TP file, will we be able
  to "push" and "pull" from that one?. Is there a safeguard
  against a "push" or "pull" in the wrong sync cycle?


- URLS not recognized (or how entered) in regulations
- copy the tp file and edit it should be fine in publishing new tournament
  -> when creating new one, and importing from other, various info (e.g.
     publishing details) were not copied. Annoying,  had to do it twice.
- paypal was only option given to pay for this, didn't see credit card
  -> seriously, it takes you 24 hours to get back to us to confirm this?
- address doesn't know how to properly do the US style of 
  city, state, zip




PREPARATION
===========

The TourneyTools are able to take a players registration list (those
emails that contains "keyword=value" pairs) into the various text
files for preparing registration and import into TP. We've used a
variety of formats for a number of years now (dcopen, njopen, mida and
also Koshy's format from the PA website).

For each event, which we normally call something like "ms-A", it will
produce a ms-A.list file as well as a ms-A.csv (comma separated value)
file. Sadly, TP does not like the latter one, so they need to be
transformed into excel (.xls) files to automate the import into TP.

Luckily there is also a tool to do this automatically in OpenOffice,
see the csv2xls shell script, although it is not too much labor to
convert a "csv" file into an "xls" file.
  NOTE:   there's now a better python procedure using openpyxl

It's quite possible you can also do this on a windows box, or mac, but
my current experience is solely with linux.

The XLS files can be imported into TP once you have established a
tournament, and you have created events and told it the size (16 or 32
or even 64 teams). There is somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd pulldown at
the top an IMPORT action <<gotta get better description of this>>

One comment on singles vs. doubles: for doubles a pair is defined by
two consequative lines, e.g. line 1 and 2 are the first pair, line 3
and 4 are the 2nd pair etc.  When you import this XLS file it is thus
very important to click on that button in the lower left to "link up
pairs" (or whatever it's called), otherwise you'll have a big mess.
Also, PTT puts the male first in mixed doubles, these are IBF
requirements.

INSTALLATION
============
Make sure you have the correct licence for BTP. The two files,
TP.DAT and TP.PD need to be in "Program Files/Visual Reality/BTP/"
If you get a *.license file, start the program, and let BTP install
this file.

WORKFLOW
========

1) create a new tournament
   Tournament ->New

   ? it is adviced to use a folder in the default location BTP suggest, and 
   maybe make a shortcut to this folder from the desktop, otherwise BTP
   keeps forcing you to navigate too much through the filesystem)
   It likes "My Documents/Tournaments"

   ->template1.tp

2) Add properties
   Under 'Events', add (or pick) events. No size of the draw is needed
   yet, and the events can also be imported from another tournament.

   -> template2.tp

3) Now for each event in the [Roster] do the following:
   (it helps to click on [Roster] on the left side, and select each event)

   Draw->Add Draw
   	     select Elimination, ->Next
	     Select size (2,4,8,16,32,...), confirm name, no Playoff 3/4, -> Next
	     Select 'First Match' (3rd bullet, need this each time) -> Next  
	     Select columns 'MemberID' and 'State' for the layout -> Next
	     Finish

	     at this stage these events still have 0 entries of course

   Once this is done, it's perhaps best to save this file in a template.
   Be sure when you do this, you CLOSE the database (the tournament),
   then go into explorer,and copy/paste to make that backup. This is
   very important, otherwise the copy is probably not sane.

   -> template3.tp

4) Now for each event you the enter the players:

   Player->Import Entries
          ->Browse ; to your XLS file
	  ->next
	  (the default fields should be correct, but check on your first import)
	  <HIT ->NEXT a few time until you have to select the Event

	  select the event you want to have this imported to.
	  IF THIS IS A DOUBLES EVENT, MAKE SURE YOU ALSO CHECK OFF THE 
	  'Link partners in odd and even rows'
	  on the lower left of the entry form.

	  ->Finish

	  if you now click on the Entries tab of this draw, you should see the newly
	  imported players

	  Now proceed and double click on the players/teams that are to be seeded
	  There is a "Seed:" entry for this once the 'Entry properties' are open.
	  -> OK
	  repeat this for 1, 2, 3/4 and 5/8.  since there are no Shadow-Seed options
	  for this program, the next level of 3/4, 5/8, 9/16 .... will have to be used

	  I don't see an option to rank by state.
     
    Draw->Make Draws

    	  select 'Separation' by 'State' in one of the selections that will come up
	  
	  look at the draw, if not happy, try 'Re-make Draw' or go ->Back and try
	  something else....
	  most likely manually swap players. See below, since that's a bit tricky.



5) It is also possible to manually modify a draw, as follows:

   From the left 'Draws' click on a draw and on the right you'll see the draw 
   Suppose A and B need to be swapped, do this:

   	   highlight A, right click, Delete Entry  (entry is actually put aside for later re-entry)
	   highlight B, right click, Delete Entry
	   highlight the spot where A was, right click, Select Entry
	   	     now select B, and OK this
	   highlight the spot where B was, right click, Select Entry
	   	     now select A, and OK this
   



Reminder of color codes the draws will have:

	 grey - nothing done, event just exists, nothing else
	        next step would be "Draw->Add Draw"
	 orange - after draw was added (size and elimination type given)
	 	next step would be "Player->Import entries"
		then "Draw->Make Draw"
	 yellow - after entries added and draws made
	 	Now go right-click->Schedule Match or
		       right-click->Schedule Round
         blue - some scheduling done
	      	continue with this scheduling
	 green - all done with scheduling
	 dark grey - all events have been played



	 red - something bad, e.g. players important but no


6) Now that your have all entries in the draws, you can setup the times to play, 
   the courts, the gyms, order or play etc.etc.   Outside the current scope.
	  


MAKING THE DRAWS
=================

We do 8 seeds and 8 shadow seeds (those are never published) for 32 players,
and 4 seeds plus 4 shadow if we have 16 players.
For below power of 2, fall back to the power of two below the count.
So for 31 we use 4 seeds and 4 shadow.

CURRENT FLAWS:
=============

TourneyTools doesn't use USAB numbers, but defines a uniq player ID which we
use during the tournament. They are 1 .. number_of_players in the tournament,
and for other reasons are defined by when they registered (1 being the first,
N being the last). Sometimes comes in handy if you have to give preference
based on this rank. But they are NOT the player number the players see, those
are from an alphabetical listing of players.


My fault/feature:
   if you import just the main list and not a 'w'(wait) list,
you will wind up having to import them again. better to have them
all in there, and the bottom one are on waiting list.

FILES:
======

template1	only named the tournament "dcopen", added the logo
template2	added the usual dcopen {ms,ws,md,wd,xd}-{A,C,S} events
template3	added the sizes (32,16,32,16,32) A,C and (16,4,16,4,16) S
template4	added courts and timeslots (13, 26, 26)
template5       imported the A's

CutePDF is a good PDF writer for Windows
BullzipPDFPrinter is another one.


- random notes:

on times: use 1-day, and start and step and number of steps
   16:30 - 23:30 is 13 steps of 30
   08.15 - 22:50 is 26 steps of 35
   08:30 - 15:30 is 13 steps of 35


BTP Tricks/Wishlist:
====================

- you can have multiple versions of BTP all grabbing the same info from the website.
  just make sure you start from the same .TP file 


Other Notes:
============

- 2014.2 was offered as an update.. scary, ok, lets do it.
  Yup, it crippled my 2013 version.
